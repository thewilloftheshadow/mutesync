MuteSync is a simple plugin that allows you to mute players in-game when they are muted on your Discord server, and unmute them when they are unmuted on your Discord server.

This plugin uses [DiscordSRV](https://modrinth.com/plugin/discordsrv) as the linking system between your Minecraft server and Discord server, so make sure that you have it installed and setup using the `linking.yml` file in DiscordSRV's configuration.

This plugin also uses [LibertyBans](https://hangar.papermc.io/A248/LibertyBans) as the mute system, so make sure that you have it installed and setup using the `config.yml` file in LibertyBans' configuration.
